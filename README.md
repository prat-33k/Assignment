I tried too build a blog application for the current assignment to incorporate as many required functionalities as possbile.

Users can register/login and upload blogs in multiple categories.

Backend: Nodejs, MySQL
Frontend: Reactjs


Clone the repository, install dependencies and connect your mysql database as given in db.js
Make a blog schem and then create two tables of users and posts where user's id acts as a foreeign key to posts.
